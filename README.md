# open-audio

This repo aims to provide a curated guide to open-source audio and music projects.

To be included in this guide, project must be open-source and freely available.

## Implementation Ideas

- Initially markdown or yml
- Eventually Store data in sqlite
- Command line interface to sqlite db
  - Generate README.md from sqlite + jinja2 template
  - Check for broken links
  - Get activity stats via apis

## topics

### csound

### pure data

### python audio software

The initial set of projects is taken from the [PythonInMusic](https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonInMusic) page on python.org. This will be reduced as projects which are no longer active or available are removed.

The current markdown translation of this page is [here](research/python-in-music.md).
