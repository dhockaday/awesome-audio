# python-audio-projects

This repo aims to provide a curated guide to python audio and music projects.

The initial set of projects is taken from the [PythonInMusic](https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonInMusic) page on python.org. This will be reduced as projects which are no longer active or available are removed.

The current markdown translation of this page is [here](python-in-music.md).


## Implementation Ideas

- Initially markdown or yml
- Eventually Store data in sqlite
- Command line interface to sqlite db
    - Generate README.md from sqlite + jinja2 template
    - Check for broken links
    - Get activity stats via apis
